# Project Proposal


# Proposal #1: Character Annotator

### What and why?

This is a browser plug-in that generates character annotations for novels or stories. It identifies and records every instance of a character, including their names, titles, relationships, and other important details. When readers click on character links, they see a summarized version of this information, making it easier to remember and understand the characters.

### For whom?

This software is for novel readers, especially when reading novels with complex characters, who have difficulty remembering every character, or wish to understand these characters more systematically.

### How?

The program spots characters in the text and collects new details about them like names, introductions, appearances, titles, and relationships. It then combines this with information previously collected, creates a summary, and stores it. In future occurrences of the same character, readers can click on their name to access the summary.

- **Character Recognition:**
  - Identify and extract characters mentioned in the text.
- **Information Extraction:**
  - Collect details about characters including names, introductions, appearances, titles, and relationships.
- **Data Storage:**
  - Create a storage system to retain collected character information.
- **Data Integration:**
  - Combine newly collected information with previously stored data for each character.
- **Summary Generation:**
  - Generate a concise summary for each character based on the combined information.
- **Link Generation:**
  - Create clickable links or references for each character's name in the text.
- **Editing and Updating:**
  - Provide a mechanism for users to edit or update character details as needed.
- **Compatibility**:
  - Able to work with multiple types of text files.

### Scope

The program's main task is intensive language processing. It needs to be adjusted to be compatible for use in a browser, and it will also have additional features to aid novel comprehension. This workload is manageable for a team of four.

# Proposal #2: WasteWise: Rescuing Food, Saving our Planet and your Wallet!


### What and Why?
The software system I would like to build is an online food marketplace platform. This platform aims to address the significant problem of food wastage in restaurants and stores, while also providing an affordable and convenient food solution for individuals.


**Problems:** Many restaurants and stores often find themselves with excess food at the end of the day, which goes unsold and ultimately becomes wasted. This is not only environmentally unsustainable but also a financial loss for businesses. Simultaneously, individuals, including those on a budget or those looking to explore new cuisines, struggle to find affordable and diverse food options. Additionally, they may hesitate to try a new restaurant or dish, fearing they might not enjoy it, leading to food and money wastage.


**Importance:** Solving these problems can reduce food waste for restaurants and provide affordable food access for people who need them on one hand. On the other hand, it can also enhance dining experiences for people who want to try new cuisines, supporting local business and fostering a sense of community engagement by connecting customers with local food establishments.


### For Whom?
This system focuses on two primary user groups:


1. **Sellers - Store and Restaurant Owners:**


User Story: As a store owner, such as at Happy Cafe, I aim to efficiently distribute surplus pastries to individuals who can benefit from them, so I can reduce food waste and let more people discover and appreciate the nice food at my cafe.

2. **Buyers - Customers Seeking Affordable Food:**


User Story 1: As a customer, I aspire to acquire a substantial quantity of food items at a reduced cost compared to their original prices so that I can plan my meals for the week while making substantial savings on my food expenses.


User Story 2: As a customer, I'm keen to explore a variety of dishes at different restaurants without spending too much money so that I can discover my preferences at a lower cost and make informed decisions about what to order during future visits to those restaurants.


### How?
Overall, this Agile Food Marketplace Software is designed to revolutionize the way food sellers and buyers interact, providing a dynamic platform for sellers to efficiently sell surplus food from their establishments while allowing buyers to access high-quality food at reduced prices. It ensures flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement throughout these potential features:


- **Message display with pictures:** Implement a user-friendly interface that enables sellers to showcase their surplus food items with detailed descriptions and high-quality images. This feature enhances the visual appeal of the listings, attracting more potential buyers and facilitating quick decision-making.
- **Interactive Map Integration:** Incorporate an interactive map displaying the geographical locations of stores and restaurants relative to potential buyers. This enables buyers to easily locate nearby food options, making it convenient and efficient to find and purchase surplus food.
- **Real-time Inventory Management:** Develop an intuitive interface with adding and subtracting buttons, allowing sellers to update the availability of surplus food items in real-time so that they can efficiently manage their inventory, ensuring accurate listings and reducing the likelihood of overcommitting on food availability.
- **Rating and Review System:** Implement a rating and review system where users can provide feedback and ratings on their food purchasing experiences. This feature promotes trust and transparency, helping both buyers and sellers make informed decisions. It also encourages sellers to maintain high-quality offerings.
- **Integrated Payment Account:** Integrate a secure payment system linked to user accounts, enabling seamless and transparent transactions. Users can conveniently complete transactions within the platform, providing insights into their spending patterns and fostering trust in the system's financial processes.

### Scope
This system embodies a traditional software development framework, facilitating interactions between two distinct user groups. While the specific domain may vary, such as a second-hand item trading platform or a house rental website, the endeavor proves highly beneficial. It is very useful and will not be too easy because it has many features (fronet-end and back-end: database, UI/UX, rating systems, etc.) to develop and practice our software developing skills. It will not be too ambitious as we can also be flexible to change the requirements (i.e adding or removing any features if needed), allowing us to incorporate new adjustments and keep the workload at a manageable level.
