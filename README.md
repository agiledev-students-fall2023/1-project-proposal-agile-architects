# Project Proposal


# Proposal #1: Character Annotator

### What and why?

This is a browser plug-in that generates character annotations for novels or stories. It identifies and records every instance of a character, including their names, titles, relationships, and other important details. When readers click on character links, they see a summarized version of this information, making it easier to remember and understand the characters.

### For whom?

This software is for novel readers, especially when reading novels with complex characters, who have difficulty remembering every character, or wish to understand these characters more systematically.

### How?

The program spots characters in the text and collects new details about them like names, introductions, appearances, titles, and relationships. It then combines this with information previously collected, creates a summary, and stores it. In future occurrences of the same character, readers can click on their name to access the summary.

- **Character Recognition:**
  - Identify and extract characters mentioned in the text.
- **Information Extraction:**
  - Collect details about characters including names, introductions, appearances, titles, and relationships.
- **Data Storage:**
  - Create a storage system to retain collected character information.
- **Data Integration:**
  - Combine newly collected information with previously stored data for each character.
- **Summary Generation:**
  - Generate a concise summary for each character based on the combined information.
- **Link Generation:**
  - Create clickable links or references for each character's name in the text.
- **Editing and Updating:**
  - Provide a mechanism for users to edit or update character details as needed.
- **Compatibility**:
  - Able to work with multiple types of text files.

### Scope

The program's main task is intensive language processing. It needs to be adjusted to be compatible for use in a browser, and it will also have additional features to aid novel comprehension. This workload is manageable for a team of four.
